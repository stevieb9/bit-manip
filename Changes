Revision history for Bit-Manip

1.03    2017-02-09
        - added bit_clr() (per PerlMonks discussion), clears selected bits
        - changed $bits param name to $nbits in code and POD as it makes it less
          ambiguous as to what we mean by the arg
        - added t/45 for testing bit_clr()

1.02    2016-01-27
        - removed erroneous "use feature 'say';" from test files, as it was
          causing Testers to break on versions < v5.10.x

1.01    2016-01-25
        - somehow I missed adding POD for the changes in bit_set()

1.00    2016-01-25
        - removed string.h include as we don't use it
        - LSB can now be equal to MSB to allow getting a single bit
        - fix issue where bit_set() was not updating bits if a leading zero was
          sent in. We now require a 'bits' param (fixes #1)

0.02    2017-01-25
        - added in EXPORT_OK POD section
        - code tidying in the XS file
        - changed all instances of "first" to msb and "last" to lsb for
          params
        - added bit_mask() returns the bit mask given a number of bits and LSB

0.01    2017-01-24
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
